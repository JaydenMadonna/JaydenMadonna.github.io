    <h1> Educational background:</h1>
    <p>I attended Kennedy Elementary and Roosevelt Elementary for Elementary school<br/>
        this is the time in my life where I learned to read, write, and basic math <br/>
        . I attended Marshall Middle for middle school this is where I found my love and interest in<br/>
        things such as science and music. Im currently attending high school at Joseph A Craig High school<br/>
        Becuase of covid-19 my last year of middle school was online and grades didnt matter so going from that <br/>
        to freshman year was pretty rough but im starting to get the hang of things.

        <h1>Volunteer Experience:</h1>
        <p>Im currently unemployed but that dosnt mean I havent done work to try and help the community<br/>
        last year and earlier this year I cleaned up trash and other junk off parks and parking lots in my general area<br/>

        <p>Im a big sport fan but ive never tried out or even wanted to join a sports team. Instead<br/>
            Ive opted to do choir and other musical endevers. Ive listend to music all my life and its helped me through alot of<br/>
            Unfortunate situations so why not join a choir or a band.
